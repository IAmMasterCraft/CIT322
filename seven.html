            Identify and correct the errors in following segments of code:
            if ( age >= 30 ); document.write (“Age greater than or equal to
            30); else document.write(“Age is less than 30);

              * error:
              * if (age >= 30); document.write("Age greater than or equal to 30");
              * else document.write("Age is less than 30");
              * 
              * BUG: 
              * - Syntax error due to unexpected semi-colon after the expression for the condition
              * - age variable is not declared as well
              * 
              * correction:
              * age = 20;
              * if (age >= 30) console.log("Age greater than or equal to 30");
              * else console.log("Age is less than 30");
